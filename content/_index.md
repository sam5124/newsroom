## Exclusive

<p style="width: 950px;margin-left: -200px;text-align: left;text-align: left;">&emsp; &emsp;Under the call of "national fitness", more and more people begin to pay attention to their physical health. As a sign on the wall of Minkang Stadium on campus says: "Exercise one hour a day, work healthily for 50 years, live happily all your life."<br><br>
&emsp; &emsp;Fitness is directly related to our physical health, but it doesn't stop there, says Tian. "Love of fitness has changed me from a fat man to an ideal body. But fitness not only means physical health, but also brings me psychological health. It makes me more confident and cheerful,and I can face life optimistically, not only in study, but also in some difficulties in life.<br><br>
&emsp; &emsp;Tian Yang, a student from the Chinese National Community College and a fitness enthusiast, is the subject of our interview.

<p style="display: flex; justify-content: center;width: 999px;margin-left: -200px;text-align: left;">&emsp; &emsp;When talking about his fitness history, Tian Yang said, "Fitness has been a hobby since junior high school. But when I really insist on it for a long time, I stopped doing it many times before college." <br><br>    
&emsp; &emsp;"I work out about five or six times a week, pretty much every day,because I don't have a busy school schedule and I divide my work evenly throughout the day, so there are very few things to do each day, which leaves a lot of time for me to work out."<br><br>
&emsp; &emsp;Tian Yang's ability to distribute his tasks equally, rather than accumulate them, is particularly valuable, and this is what fitness brings to him.<br><br>
&emsp; &emsp;"In fact, I gradually spread my thoughts through the habit of exercise," he said. "I would like to think, can I play some of my characteristics in some other fields, and develop some strengths? That is to say, since I can persist in the field of sports and fitness for so long, then some other small hobbies, I should also be able to work hard to complete it, I am holding this idea to do some other meaningful things.

<p style="display: flex; justify-content: center;width: 999px;margin-left: -200px;text-align: left;">&emsp; &emsp;Fitness changes Tianyang in all aspects. Its influence on him is not only physical, but also mental. It also spreads his various interests and hobbies, and cultivates a very valuable personality quality.<br><br>
&emsp; &emsp;The author said: "Fitness is a good medicine for you."<br><br>
&emsp; &emsp;Tian Yang replied, "Yes, I think so."<br><br>
&emsp; &emsp;Talking about his plans for the future, Tian said, "I think I will continue to exercise and keep fit, and then I will influence the people around me more positively and carry forward the spirit of national fitness. For the future, I also want to develop professionally, but it is still too far away. At present, I just want to move forward step by step and do well in my studies first. If the pressure of study or employment is really great, I will choose to turn sports and fitness into a career."
Tian Yang's view of "crispy college students" is also very "Buddha", he said: "Not necessarily like sports and fitness is not a" crispy college students ", so I think as long as you have your own hobbies, as long as you have your own dreams, you can live happily every day."<br><br>
&emsp; &emsp;As a participant of the top ten sunshine sports figures on the campus, he said: "This is the vice president of the student union of our college contacted me and said that there was this activity and wanted to push me up. At that time, I was very surprised, because my fitness is only a small hobby, can not be regarded as a great story to promote, but he specially contacted me, said let me go to participate, then I hold a try mentality to participate.<br><br>
&emsp; &emsp;The author asked, "What do you think is the meaning of bodybuilding?"<br><br>
&emsp; &emsp;Tian Yang said: "The most important thing is to keep our body and mind healthy. This is the meaning of fitness."
